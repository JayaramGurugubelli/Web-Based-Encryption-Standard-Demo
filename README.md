# 🔐 Web-Based Encryption Standard Demo
A web-based tool to demonstrate AES, DES, RSA, and SHA encryption. Built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript using CryptoJS and JSEncrypt. Users can encrypt/decrypt text or generate hashes. Educational, interactive, and fully client-side with a responsive UI.# 

This project is a web-based tool that demonstrates how different encryption and hashing algorithms work, including **AES**, **DES**, **RSA**, and **SHA256**. It's built using **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript** with cryptographic libraries like **CryptoJS** and **JSEncrypt**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Encrypt and decrypt messages using:
  - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  - DES (Data Encryption Standard)
  - RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)
- 🔐 Generate SHA256 hashes (one-way encryption)
- 📦 Responsive UI built with Bootstrap
- 🔑 Key input support for AES, DES, and RSA
- 🔄 Easy switching between algorithms

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** & **Bootstrap 5** for layout and styling
- **JavaScript** for core logic
- **CryptoJS** for AES, DES, and SHA
- **JSEncrypt** for RSA encryption/decryption

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the plain text you want to encrypt.
4. Select an encryption algorithm from the dropdown.
5. Enter a key (not needed for SHA).
6. Click **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
7. View the result in the output box.

> 💡 Note: SHA is a hashing function, so it's one-way and **cannot be decrypted**.
